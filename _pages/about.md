# Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the **Fralin Biomedical Research Institute (FBRI) Cancer Research Center at Virginia Tech**, located on the Children’s National Research & Innovation Campus in Washington, D.C.

Originally from Tianjin, China, my research focuses on **bone metastasis** and tumor–microenvironment interactions using integrative genomic approaches.

My work aims to understand how tumor cells adapt to the bone metastatic niche through transcriptional plasticity, regulatory variation, and immune–stromal remodeling.

## Research

Bone metastasis represents a highly dynamic and context-dependent ecosystem.  
I study:

- Remodeling of immune and stromal populations in metastatic bone lesions  
- Transcriptional reprogramming and alternative splicing during metastatic progression  
- Integration of GWAS / eQTL / sQTL / CNV with single-cell transcriptomics  
- Identification of regulatory drivers and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities  

My long-term goal is to bridge **genetic variation, single-cell state transitions, and therapeutic response prediction** in metastatic cancer.
